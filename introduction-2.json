In microbiome research, both metatranscriptomics and metaproteomics help in the precise functional analysis of microbial communities that form clusters.\nWhile metatranscriptomic data offer insights into the expression and activity of genes in the environment, metaproteomic information includes protein expression and regulation data. As a result, metaproteomic data can differ from metatranscriptomic data.\nIn metaproteomics, mass spectrometry is used to analyze the proteins within microbial communities. This involves the extraction of proteins from a microbial community, separation of proteins using liquid chromatography (LC), and detection of proteins using tandem mass spectrometry to identify each protein.\nEfforts have been made to improve protein specificity by using high-performance mass spectrometry and developing sophisticated chromatography methods for protein separation. However, it’s important to note that traditional mass spectrometry-based metaproteomic analysis has limitations. Only a fraction of the microbiome sample can be profiled, and low molecular weight proteins are less likely to be detected compared to high molecular weight proteins. Additionally, the frequency of analysis is much lower when compared to metatranscriptomic analysis.","position":{"start":{"line":6,"column":1},"end":{"line":6,"column":1}},"key":"tmA4eAla0W"}],"key":"ZYkeG6Z230"},{"type":"container","children":[{"type":"image","style":{"width":"90%"},"url":"/build/75d390134430cb9d5bf8b8faeb6f3c9c.png","alt":"Multi-omics information-based microbiome functional analysis","data":{"altTextIsAutoGenerated":true},"key":"Bf6lgNFaBP","urlSource":"https://github.com/sujin9819/MetaInsight/blob/main/SOP/MetaProteomic/img/P_0_1.png?raw=true"},{"type":"caption","children":[{"type":"paragraph","children":[{"type":"strong","children":[{"type":"text","value":"Multi-omics information-based microbiome functional analysis","key":"K7AtIMX638"}],"key":"Agsx8ikOG9"}],"key":"oCwGLjEOsl"}],"key":"abqTCMgE21"}],"enumerator":"1","key":"m91w6nd7qi"},{"type":"heading","depth":2,"position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1},"end":{"line":16,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ribo-sequencing","position":{"start":{"line":16,"column":1},"end":{"line":16,"column":1}},"key":"ZGecs7TfDS"}],"identifier":"ribo-sequencing","label":"Ribo-sequencing","html_id":"ribo-sequencing","implicit":true,"key":"lo8r1klSbU"},{"type":"paragraph","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":25,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ribo-seq is a protein analysis technique that applies sequencing technology to study the ribosome-protected mRNA sequences.\nIn this method, cells are treated with chloramphenicol to fix their state, and MNase is used to remove DNA and RNA that are not protected by ribosomes.\nThe sequencing is then performed on the mRNA sequences actively involved in protein synthesis.\nRibo-seq was introduced in 2009 in a Science publication and has since been used to profile ribosomes ","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"key":"oYJx6FlJvu"},{"type":"cite","url":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17081-z","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"[ref]","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"key":"gUGgVVc7NO"}],"kind":"narrative","label":"Fremin_2020","identifier":"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-020-17081-z","enumerator":"1","key":"dQwtHMBG98"},{"type":"text","value":".\nIt has been employed to investigate how protein synthesis changes in yeast under different nutritional conditions, such as rich and depleted states.\nRibo-seq allows the quantification of protein synthesis by encrypting the genes responsible for ongoing protein production.\nThis technique provides insights into gene information encoding the proteins being synthesized, allowing for accurate quantification of protein synthesis.\nFurthermore, Ribo-seq has been reported to produce reliable metaproteomic analysis results when applied to fecal samples preserved in RNALater, making it a valuable tool for metaproteomic analysis in various settings.","position":{"start":{"line":18,"column":1},"end":{"line":18,"column":1}},"key":"aGtVjaM72u"}],"key":"pXaewiPB79"},{"type":"container","children":[{"type":"image","style":{"width":"90%"},"url":"/build/a944df8a9a68dcbf4523439ddd11e331.jpeg","alt":"MetaRibo-seq을 포함한 마이크로바이옴 분석 workflow ;
