# META-Insight

Meta-omics Analysis Protocols for Microbiome Research

## About

Metagenomic analysis is an innovative approach to interpreting complex biological information to understand the ecology, function, diversity, and interactions of microbial communities.

Our goal is to introduce state-of-the-art analytical methods that enable accurate meta-omics analysis and provide meta-omics data derived from the accurate gut microbiome of healthy individuals.

## Key Features

- **Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs)**: Organizes microbial community information at the genome level
- **Multi-omics Integration**: Combines metagenome, metatranscriptome, and metaproteome data
- **Comprehensive Protocols**: Step-by-step analysis pipelines for each omics type

## Protocols

### Metagenomics
De novo genome analysis through shotgun sequencing, supporting both Illumina short reads and PacBio long reads.

### Metatranscriptomics
MAG-based reference-guided and reference-independent analysis for gene expression profiling.

### Metaproteomics (Ribo-seq)
Alternative method for mass-based analysis using ribosome profiling to quantify protein synthesis.
