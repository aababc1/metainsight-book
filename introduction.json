These results are advantageous for rapidly identifying “what changes” across cohorts and for examining the impact of preprocessing and data quality variations on profiles.

This allows function to be understood not as a simple inventory but within the context of genomic repertoire, enabling interpretations about whether functional changes are driven by specific lineages or genetic units.

The distinction between the two analytical axes can be substantially understood not as algorithmic differences but as limits determined by the information content and contextual scope permitted by individual reads.

Simultaneously, in assembly-free analysis, the increased contextual information carried by longer reads can alleviate uncertainty in taxonomy assignment and enable more direct mapping and interpretation of functional units.

This trend increasingly incorporates read-type combination design—tailored to data characteristics and target outputs rather than constrained to a single sequencing technology—as an essential component of metagenomic workflow design.
